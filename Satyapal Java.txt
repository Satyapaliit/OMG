Strictfp-> used to restrict the floating point calculation when a given variable is run on different plateforms
	i.e. 16/32/64 bit processors.

	->can not be used with abstract method.
	-> can be used with abstract class and Interface.
Memory->When a object is created using 'New', a memory is created in 'Heap' and referenced is returned.
Two Dimentional  Array->




Aliases-> the references that holds the address of the same object.
Static VAriable -> a static variable is initialised when a class is loaded at runtime.
->accessing the static variable using references is a BAD habit.
-> two mechanism for Inheritance:
1-> Inheritance and,
2->Aggression: when a instance variable is itself a reference of some another class.
-> Object s in java can not contain other objects instead they can contain the reference to the other object. 
->Literal:constant value.
->Octal:(Zero)045
->Hexadecimal:(Zero)0x457.
-> A character Literal is represented using 16-bit Unicode Character set.
-> a Unicode character can always be specified as a set of four digit hexadecimal characters prefixed by '\u'.
