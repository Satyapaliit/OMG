Strictfp-> used to restrict the floating point calculation when a given variable is run on different plateforms
	i.e. 16/32/64 bit processors.

	->can not be used with abstract method.
	-> can be used with abstract class and Interface.
Memory->When a object is created using 'New', a memory is created in 'Heap' and referenced is returned.
Two Dimentional  Array->




Aliases-> the references that holds the address of the same object.
Static VAriable -> a static variable is initialised when a class is loaded at runtime.
->accessing the static variable using references is a BAD habit.
-> two mechanism for Inheritance:
1-> Inheritance and,
2->Aggression: when a instance variable is itself a reference of some another class.
-> Object s in java can not contain other objects instead they can contain the reference to the other object. 
->Literal:constant value.
->Octal:(Zero)045
->Hexadecimal:(Zero)0x457.
-> A character Literal is represented using 16-bit Unicode Character set.
-> a Unicode character can always be specified as a set of four digit hexadecimal characters prefixed by '\u'.


*******************04/06/2019*****************
-> Unlike C the Java do not passes the name of the program as the argument to the main() method.
-> Importing the Class with same name from different Package would not compile.
->Members of the named package can not access the classes and the interfaces defined in the default paqckage.
->static import:used to importthe static members of the class. import static <member>, import and static can not be reversed.

->LOcal Variables and method parameters can not be defined with access modifiers otherwise it will throw compilation error.
-> Java has Four Access modifiers not Three.
protected: same package and all derieved classes of same or different package.
